@DeludedOne,The whole thing about the hunters just pre killing the bosses is a bit cheap. They should only spawn when both the speedrunner and them are there for things to be equal. Not sure if the mod allows for that.,anger
@matissimoj1190,Finally a run,anger
@theonewhoasked513,Its been so long aince ive watched one of these,joy
@philipg6432,I feel like the hunters are entirely too stacked compared to the runner. Maybe limiting their masks to 3 or 4 would make it more fair. Especially when they stack dreamers,joy
@aruretheincomprehensible20,If you want a recommendation for limiting your power in future Speedrunners vs Hunters,sadness
@Pyruswatcher,Love this game mod,joy
@possessedpicklejar4762,Always happy to get another one of these,joy
@greatazuredragon,Nice episode,joy
@elviraolsen,these videos are like crack to me PLZ KEEP MAKING THEM,sadness
@levifoster5639,Wonder how hard it would be if they did this with a mirror-mode. Everyone would be rushing in the wrong directions,fear
@Rayneworld,This was a fun one! I like the inclusion of Hunter's having bosses and being able to enter the arenas. Everyone did well!,sadness

@owengonzalez6819,This has to be my new favorite Vesselhunt video! Iâ€™m a huge fan of the unconventional routes caused by the hunters,sadness
@ondrajankuj156,I just want to point out that you were maybe too harsh with those speedrunner caps. It is good to have them in some form but I still think they are too limiting. 5 notches is like nothing.,joy
@user-op2xz9fe7v,25:28 youâ€™re the only that had adrenaline they wasnâ€™t even thinking of killing youðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,sadness
