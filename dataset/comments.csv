@DeludedOne,The whole thing about the hunters just pre killing the bosses is a bit cheap. They should only spawn when both the speedrunner and them are there for things to be equal. Not sure if the mod allows for that.
@matissimoj1190,Finally a run, where actually hunters had something to do and not just waiting for fire to show up, it was a great show!
@theonewhoasked513,Its been so long aince ive watched one of these, good times.
@philipg6432,I feel like the hunters are entirely too stacked compared to the runner. Maybe limiting their masks to 3 or 4 would make it more fair. Especially when they stack dreamers, or early game routes are limited. Its too much health to churn through for a single player vs 4. I'd also make nail arts do 2 masks of damage. That'd incentivize them to protect those areas too, opening options for the runner and REALLY being impactful grabs.
@aruretheincomprehensible20,If you want a recommendation for limiting your power in future Speedrunners vs Hunters, you can consider limiting power by the completion percent the item gives. For example, this run you only allowed yourself to collect 1 mask, 1 vessel, 2 nail upgrades, and 2 charm notches. Those total 4% completion (1 each for masks, vessels, and nail upgrades), so between masks, vessels, and nail upgrades you're only allowed to collect 4 of them. This would open up an interesting choice between seeking out mask shards for more survivability (especially against players), seeking out nail upgrades to kill bosses faster, or going for a mix of both for a more well-rounded build. This opens up 2 immediate problems in that charm notches don't count towards completion percentage (which opens up the problem of the speedrunner being too strong right back up) and you never seem to go for soul vessels during your playthrough (which also adds extra power to the speedrunner), but it can be expanded to create a more interesting format.First, limiting your build by a certain completion percentage provides more choices in how you make your build. For example, if your limits were based on the completion percentage based on extra masks, soul fragments, nail arts, level 2 spells, and charms, then you would have to more carefully weigh the benefits of whether the option of using a charm is good in the short term vs how it affects your build in the long term, prevents you from purchasing most charm notches since most of them require a lot of charms (Salubra sells most of them), and you would need to choose between survivability, PVP combat effectiveness, and PVE combat effectiveness all throughout the game instead of getting all the PVP combat effectiveness you could ever want (excluding the hunter bans) while limiting survivability and PVE combat effectiveness.Second, the limit itself can be numerically adjusted based on feedback. For example, a limit of 9 would be just enough to fit your current build (Shade Soul, 3 nail arts, Nailmaster's Glory, 1 extra mask, 2 nail upgrades, and one additional charm (I saw you purchase Quick Focus so I assume that's what you equipped)), but you might find that either too limiting and increase the limit or find it too strong and reduce it so the hunters have more of a chance. There's a lot of ways you can adjust your power cap based on this metric to balance your own power limits between "getting every upgrade" and "not having enough power to get through various in-game challenges".Third, you can adjust how different upgrades affect the completion percentage based on perception and common bans. For example, making charm notches count as 1 completion percentage provides a limit to the charm builds you have available in a similar way to what you have in the current ruleset, while making Descending Dark cost 2 completion percentage gives your hunters another consideration when it comes to banning it (since DDark seems to be the only spell they ban).Finally, you can consider re-adding some of the power by offering distinct side challenges that let you obtain some extra power within the run. One of the problems with older rulesets (which you listed below) is that there wasn't any incentive to get you to not seek out extra upgrades until you know you can overpower the hunters, but one of the problems with most of the current rulesets is that there's no incentive for the hunters to leave the last dreamer to keep you from getting upgrades. For example, if you had "defeat Troupemaster Grimm" as a reward that offered extra power, then you could give the hunters an incentive to stop guarding a single dreamer. Realistically, I think the Grimm Troupe questline and the Colosseum of Fools would be the best ways to start with adding power questlines because they take place in an arena in a distinct location where the hunters can defend it practically and can offer distinct subgoals that alert the hunters that you're going for a particular questline.
@Pyruswatcher,Love this game mod
@possessedpicklejar4762,Always happy to get another one of these
@greatazuredragon,Nice episode, good work.
@elviraolsen,these videos are like crack to me PLZ KEEP MAKING THEM
@levifoster5639,Wonder how hard it would be if they did this with a mirror-mode. Everyone would be rushing in the wrong directions
@Rayneworld,This was a fun one! I like the inclusion of Hunter's having bosses and being able to enter the arenas. Everyone did well!
@BAGELMAN123,Can't believe a Canadian teacher is this good at a game ðŸ˜‚
@vincentmartelli9850,That Uumuu rng was crazy
@XquizetBlix,"Hope wrecked me at the end"Doesn't it always
@icecontrol1874,Idea: against teo hunters, you cant damage them but enemies are invisible to them so you need to use your environment.
@owengonzalez6819,This has to be my new favorite Vesselhunt video! Iâ€™m a huge fan of the unconventional routes caused by the hunters, from grabbing Tram Pass to Nailmasterâ€™s Glory, amazing vid! Hope to see more hunts like this one
@ondrajankuj156,I just want to point out that you were maybe too harsh with those speedrunner caps. It is good to have them in some form but I still think they are too limiting. 5 notches is like nothing.
@user-op2xz9fe7v,25:28 youâ€™re the only that had adrenaline they wasnâ€™t even thinking of killing youðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
