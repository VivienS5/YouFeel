@c.s127,But i dont get it normally Pay2win is strongly prohibited by mojang or ?
@hayabusa10055,Hypixel has ability to gift ranks to other players, and the guy that has #1 spot is around 27,000 ranks gifted so far. Cheapest one being vip for 6,99 it comes to around 190k just from him and his rank gifting "if he only gifted vip's that is"
@marekgenerowicz4401,It does not show 100% of the picture,this does not take server costs into account
@akshayrenjith,Considering how the owner of hypixel owns a mclaren senna, it makes a lot of snese
@DreamXP,Should‚Äôve done MCCI and leonemc
@miloldr,U can calculate revenue from buying booster cookies and fire sales. At gdrag skin Hypixel made few hundrend thousand if I'm right in 8 minutes. But overall with booster cookie thing it's also in the thousands a week.
@homersimpson2293,Some of these ‚Äûrecently bought‚Äú menus have to be faked to get more real sales I guess
@HG_Playz.,I Am Playing HylexMC :D
@sushilabacchawat8637,Dude your own server has crates and ranks!??! Do you have an explanation for it?? And does having crates and ranks mean that  the server is pay to win??!!
@milkey_mc,I wonder how much hoplite makes
@BlankRequest,Have you considered that some servers bot the recently paid players on their webpage?
@dejazO0,on hypixel everyone is vip or plus you will rarely see peoples like me who never spend anything on hypixel. And its good to pay, it reduces hours of grind..
@RedDiamondREC,I lose money on mine :,D
@kacorvixon,11:10 craftmc fake slots(spoofing player count), if u gonna count all the players online on all these servers, it wont be the same as the motd shows,
@joee-kp7qt,Finally someone said hypixel skyblock is p2w
@Gustav6830,Dark mvp++ is crazy expensive lol
@dawson8301,I have a theory back when skyblock gems were released the server was doing over a million a day back during/before covid
@imsergioh,now only you can imagine how much money do tebex win throw Minecraft Servers... JASDASHDASHSDAHASD
