@SomethingRandomChannel,"thanks so much for this video series Sentdex, I know I'm late to the game but I noticed that you don't normalize the numbers when you make a prediction request. However, when we trained the model we did normalize before handing over the data to fit. I tried normalizing the data before making a prediction and I got rubbish results, when i took the normalization out it worked fine. Why is it that we train on normalized numbers but don't prepare our prediction request data in the same way?"
@luizhenriquedefreitasassis2051,That was really good. Congratulations man!
@camao4938,"hi, thank you so much for these videos, really help me out!"
@jigglymonkey4317,are these new images stored in the same folder as the training images? im confused on that since there wasn't a change to the directory
@jaewooko4527,"Could you advise how to adjust code for more than two categories..  I am working on electronic circuit analysis to classify range of symbols such as diode, capacitor and resistor. Thank a lot."
@jaewooko4527,Thanks a lot.. I was trying recent tensorflowlite..  Your tut helped to start over from basic and detail. All sample files are working great!

@rajatvardam2787,1 million subscribers and only 2.6k likes... this is odd... such a useful tutorial this one is....
@SalehAbod8,"Thanks for the great tutorial.I would suggest replacing '""int"" with ""round"" in the last part:print(CATEGORIES[int(prediction[0][0])]) >>>> print(CATEGORIES[round(prediction[0][0])])Since round will produce dog for prediction <0.5 and cat for >=0.5"

@kevcritc,"This is great. I was following the tensor flow tutorial and then I was like great, how do I apply this ??? Your tutorial has solved this basic question."
@drygordspellweaver8761,when you're reshaping an RGB image REMEMBER THE '3'!
@chaosmaker781,Hi I have a very annoying error: the reshape changed and it just accepts 2 inputs now How to correct it?

@h4dri664,You are the best
@hieutvm5627,how can I use this model for object detection ?
@hobbitthegobbit,You are the life saver man and a great lecturer
@eranfeit,"Hi,
This is a Python tutorial that walks through, for detecting objects in images and real time video.
This tutorial is based on TensorFlow and pre-trained model
 The link for the video : https://youtu.be/40_NC2Ahs_8
 I also shared the Python code in the video description .
 Enjoy
 Eran"

@matancadeporco,"i'm wondering if is there a way to calculate the time spent on a trained model? already trained them but i didnt pay attention on the time spent... now i need to know the time spent, should i retrain all of them again?"
